# Development state

Snapshot date: 2026-07-15 (Europe/Moscow).

Stage 1 is closed. Immutable tag `v0.1.0` points to
`a8c7959fb1d53dd99771a184443aa16afd287aa6`; its prerelease remains unchanged. Release workflow
[29289031923](https://github.com/TrPavel/membrane-visual-qc/actions/runs/29289031923) passed on
Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12. Graphical v0.1 validation passed with Incentive PyMOL 3.1.8.

## Stage 2 — merged, unreleased

Stage 2 was squash-merged from
[#2](https://github.com/TrPavel/membrane-visual-qc/pull/2) into `main`. It remains unreleased;
no v0.2.0 tag or release has been created.

Implemented:

- immutable pure-Python `PlanarMembrane` and one classifier for legacy/global and arbitrary planes;
- signed, centre, boundary, outside, and asymmetric normalised depth;
- strict local orientation JSON/schema with deterministic serialisation and SHA-256 provenance;
- report schema 1.1 while released schema 1.0 stays immutable;
- arbitrary-plane CGO rendering sized from selection extents;
- orientation-file commands and minimal GUI mode;
- deterministic rotation/translation/reversal tests and a rotated 1UBQ PyMOL fixture.

The unchanged `mvqc_check zmin/zmax` maps to centre `(0,0,0)`, normal `(0,0,1)`, and source
`manual_global_z`. All five legacy summaries remain unchanged; `bad_core_lys` remains 10 core and
exactly one charged review item. Rotated 1UBQ uses
`R=[[0,0,1],[0,1,0],[-1,0,0]]`, `t=[10,-5,3]`, and normal `[1,0,0]`, with the complete summary
equal to legacy 1UBQ.

Stage 2 uses development version `0.2.0.dev0` consistently in package metadata, generated reports,
wheel/sdist names, and `dist/MembraneVisualQC-0.2.0.dev0.zip`. Local correction evidence:
Ruff passed; 153 tests passed with 80% combined coverage; seven schema-1.1 reports validated; PyMOL
3.1.8 smoke plus five legacy and one rotated case passed; wheel/sdist built; two development ZIPs
were byte-identical. The correction-build ZIP SHA-256 is
`841abe95cad44b99108cb4834ad593ef0bb4e99f64b8572cad87f088a5ac8307`; it is not a replacement
for the published v0.1 asset.

The final lifecycle correction removes duplicate GUI orientation parsing. Commands now clear stale
review/report or slab state before orientation-file validation, while the GUI displays returned
source metadata only after success and `unavailable` after failure. Manual and headless rotated
1UBQ preparation share `demo/rotated_1ubq_transform.py`.

Complete interactive acceptance passed on Windows 10 build 26200 with Incentive PyMOL 3.1.8. The
graphical arbitrary plane, footprint/framing, summary equivalence, review styling, exports,
orientation/depth evidence, invalid-file lifecycle, source reset, zero-normal rejection, and
`mvqc_clear` object preservation all passed. The installed ZIP correctly reported Git commit
provenance as unavailable; structure provenance was unavailable because no explicit `input_path`
was supplied. Stage 2 implementation, acceptance, and merge are complete.

Final PR head `272f288819965e72a53e4ea6fe3cb953131c3881` passed
[PR workflow 29410043646](https://github.com/TrPavel/membrane-visual-qc/actions/runs/29410043646)
on Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12. It was squash-merged as
`faa7bae062c4ae43a9e9b738f6392bc2a228eb0e`; the corresponding
[post-merge main workflow 29410159752](https://github.com/TrPavel/membrane-visual-qc/actions/runs/29410159752)
also passed all three jobs.

## Final Stage 2 status

Stage 2 is complete and merged into main.
